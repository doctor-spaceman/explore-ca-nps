# Explore National Parks in California

## Description
This is a portfolio project that gets data from several APIs and organizes that information on the front-end.

The National Park Service API offered an opportunity to combine my love of national parks and protected natural spaces with my first VueJS-driven coding project. I limited the scope of the project to the state of California, where I live, as a way of showcasing the amazing places that are accessible to the public, as well as improving my own understanding of the state's national parks and monuments - particularly, basic information, where they are in relation to eachother, and accessibility and weather information to help rough out plans for visiting.
