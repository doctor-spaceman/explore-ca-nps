# Explore National Parks in California

## Description
This is a portfolio project that gets data from several APIs and organizes that information on the front-end.

The National Park Service API offered an opportunity to combine my love of national parks and protected natural spaces with my first single-page app. I limited the scope of the project to the state of California, where I live, as a way of showcasing the amazing places that are accessible to the public. Of all the information available from the API, I chose basic park information along with park alerts and seasonal conditions.

I worked with the Google Maps API to better show the parks in relation to eachother, and integrating with the OpenWeather API to show the weather forecast further increased the usefulness of the app as a planning tool.

Completing this project had the additional benefit of improving my own understanding of the state's national parks and monuments!
