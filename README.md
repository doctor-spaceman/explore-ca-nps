# Explore National Parks in California

## Description
This is a portfolio project that gets data from several APIs and organizes that information on the front-end.

The main purpose of this project was to explore VueJS. As a fan of parks and open spaces, I thought I’d see what the National Park Service API could offer. I limited the scope of the project to the state of California, where I live, as a way of controlling how much data would be handled, and to showcase all the amazing places accessible to the public. Of all the information available from the API, I chose basic park information along with park alerts and seasonal conditions.

I used the Google Maps API to display the parks on a map. I also integrated with the OpenWeather API to show a weather forecast for each park. Both of these features improved the app’s usefulness as a lightweight trip planning tool. I love being able to load up the app and immediately gain a better understanding of my state’s national parks and monuments.
